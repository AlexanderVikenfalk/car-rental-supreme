#### Other remarks ####
This assignment was supposed to be done by a group of 2-3 people over the course of 3 weeks. For different reasons, I ended up doing it by myself in 1 week and unfortunately this is very evident when looking at the quality of the finished product. I would like to revisit this project one day and redo everything so it feels more profesionell.
